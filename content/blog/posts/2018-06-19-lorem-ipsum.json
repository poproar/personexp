In this post I am going to break down little bits I know and start filling in the gaps. \n\nOff the top of my head, let us learn how to explain this to a child, different acronyms relating to serial communication. \n\nI am often confused by the fact that UART is disguised in USB with a bridge. \n\n| Acronym | Name |\n|:---:|:---|\n| UART | Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter |\n| USB | Universal Serial Bus |\n| SPI | Serial Peripheral Interface |\n| I<sup>2</sup>C | Inter-Integrated Circuit |\n|Ethernet ||\n\n## USB | Universal Serial Bus\na differential and bi-directional interface. \n2 pins: D+, D-  \n[stack exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/241996/usb-uart-spi-difference-and-usage)\n\n## UART | Universal _Asynchronous_ Receiver Transmitter\nAlso called RS-232(C), EIA-232, TIA-232, COM port\nNo clock. Comm determined by Baudrate / bitrate\nPeer-to-peer. 3 wires, TX, RX, GND.\nbits per second, with stop bits, data bits, and possibly a parity bit for error checking (even or odd) \n\n\n## I<sup>2</sup>C | Inter-Integrated Circuit\nUses 2 lines (Can also include +5V and GND) Possible 128 Devices on the bus with 7-bit addressing. (Rare) 10-bit addressing = 1024 devices.\n\n||||\n|---:|:---|---:|\n| **SCL** | _Serial_ Clock | for sync |\n| **SDA** | _Serial_ Data | for info |\n\n[Clear explanation](https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/i2c-tutorial)\n\n## SPI | Serial Peripheral Interface\nSynchronizing \n> Receiving hardware can be a simple shift register making SPI popular. Simpler and cheaper than the full-up UART. -[SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi/all#a-synchronous-solution)\n\nFaster than I<sup>2</sup>C but limited to number of devices.\n\n||||\n|---:|:---|---:|\n| **SCK** | _Serial_ Clock | for timing |\n| **MISO** | _Master_ In _Slave_ Out | for ? |\n| **MOSI** | _Master_ Out _Slave_ In | for ? |\n| **SS** | Slave Select | for ? |\n\n\n\n"
